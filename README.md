Iris dataset was found from UCI ML Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data
Here, different types of algorithms were used to classify the iris dataset
The cross validation was done manually by shuffling the dataset
Number of training set was 120 and number of test set was 30
Accuracy was between 93.33% to 100%
